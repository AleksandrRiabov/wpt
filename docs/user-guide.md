Welcome to the MERN Warehouse Planning Tool dashboard! The dashboard provides a visual representation of key metrics and insights to streamline your warehouse planning process. Here's an overview of the six main components:

1. **Order Demand History Area Chart**

The first component is a dynamic area chart that displays the historical trend of ordered demand and corresponding pallets picked. Use this chart to identify upcoming spikes in demand and plan accordingly. You can apply filters and settings to focus on specific data points. Refer to the "Chart Filters" section for more details.


2. **Demand vs. Picked Pallets Line Chart**

The second component features two line charts that compare demand and pallet stacking. Detect anomalies and changes in stacking patterns that may require investigation. Applying filters and date ranges helps you analyze data effectively. 
In usual circumstances, the two lines will maintain parallel, indicating a consistent stacking efficiency.
However, when a significant gap occurs between the two lines, this suggests an anomaly. Anomalies could signify issues such as partial picking or inefficient consolidation, leading to increased delivery costs.

3. **Average Cases per Pallet Bar Chart**

Number 3 showcases a bar chart illustrating the average number of cases per pallet for a specific product within the selected date range. Just like other charts, you can modify settings to tailor the view to your needs.

4. **Trailers Board**
