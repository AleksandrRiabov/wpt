# WPT (Warehouse Planning Tool) 

The WPT (Warehouse Planning Tool) front-end repository is a part of a MERN stack application that I am currently developing. This application is designed to help warehouses plan the number of trailers required to dispatch orders efficiently. When the application is ready, I plan to integrate an AI library to predict future orders volume based on past data, enabling warehouses to plan ahead and better allocate resources effectively.

The front-end is being developed using ReactJS, Redux Toolkit (RTK), TypeScript, and Recharts. 
- ReactJS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Redux Toolkit (RTK) is a library that helps manage state in React applications
- TypeScript is a strongly-typed language that adds additional safety and functionality to JavaScript
- Recharts is a library for building charts and graphs.

#### `This repository is open to collaboration and contributions from anyone who wants to help build this application. You can fork the repository and create a pull request with any changes you make, create an issue if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for new features, or reach out to me directly on LinkedIn or email with any ideas you have.`

### Please note that this is a work in progress and the application is not yet ready for use. This repository contains the code for the front-end logic of the application.
